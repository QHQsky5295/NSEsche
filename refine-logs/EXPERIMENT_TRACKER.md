No main-paper experiment group is currently `paper_ready_closed`.

M1 diagnosis closure: the 30 fixed D01--D05 runs completed on attempt 1 with
zero quarantine.  Running-warm candidates were available for 79.56% of
273,972 players, and 29.40% of those candidates were bypassed.  The next
selection stage requires a new preregistered operational family and a fresh
development seed bank; D01--D20 cannot be reused for that selection.

M1 completion-guard closure: all 30 tapes, 90 references, and 90 screen runs
completed on attempt 1 with zero quarantine.  The unchanged `ready_order`
control won the preregistered global maximin rule, so the guard family was
rejected and qualification derivation failed closed.  The result audit traced
the failure to a static projected-finish proxy overriding the paper utility's
dynamic within-window externality and concentrating assignments.  Any
successor must be a separately preregistered contention-aware family on a new
seed bank; the D21--D40 guard qualification and M2 remain unauthorized.
